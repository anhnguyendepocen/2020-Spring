# What's new?

Students taking this course should have already taken [Programming for Analytics](https://emse-p4a-gwu.github.io/). If you haven't, I **strongly** recommend you review the lessons and assignments on the [previous semester website](https://emse6574-gwu.github.io/2019-Fall/).

While this course follows a similar structure as P4A, there will be several key distinctions:

1. Whereas in P4A we worked with nice, tidy data sets, in this course we will be working more with messy, "raw" data that often needs to be significantly processed before being able to explore it.
2. Assignments will be more complex and involve more real-world data problems that often have multiple solutions.
3. This course will center around an individual semester-long project that will make up a considerable portion of your final grade.

# The syllabus

The [syllabus](syllabus.html) is lengthy, but I do expect you to look through each section. If any changes need to be made, you'll be notified through Slack.

# Course Mantras

Here are some philosophies that will get you far in data analytic work. We will be revisiting these over and over again.

**1) Embrace plain text**

You will write code to produce rich outputs that include text and graphics. While your output may have lots of different formatting, your code will be written in **plain text**.

**2) Embrace reproducibility**

Everything you produce in this course will be a reproducible output. That is, you should be able to reproduce your output from the raw data and code. For example, This webpage was generated from [this markdown source file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emse-eda-gwu/2020-Spring/master/L1.1-course-introduction.Rmd) on GitHub.

If you want to generate this very HTML page, download the `.Rmd` file and run the following code in R:

```{r eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::render('L1.1-course-introduction.Rmd')
```

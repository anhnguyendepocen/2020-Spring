# What's new?

Most students taking this course should have already taken [Programming for Analytics](https://emse-p4a-gwu.github.io/). While this course follows a similar structure, there will be several key distinctions:

1. It will require a greater deal of individual judgment to apply concepts to data problems.
2. Whereas in P4A we worked with nice, tidy data sets, in this course we will be working more with messy, "raw" data that often needs to be pre-processed before using it to answer questions or create visualizations.
3. This course will center around individual course projects that will make up a considerable portion of your final grade.

# Course Mantras

Here are some philosophies that will get you far in data analytic work. We will be revisiting these over and over again.

**1) Embrace plain text**

You will write code to produce rich outputs that include text and graphics. While your output may have lots of different formatting, your code will be written in **plain text**.

**2) Embrace reproducibility**

Everything you produce in this course will be a reproducible output. That is, you should be able to reproduce your output from the raw data and code. For example, This webpage was generated from [this markdown source file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emse-eda-gwu/2020-Spring/master/L1.1-course-introduction.Rmd) on GitHub.

If you want to generate this very HTML page, download the `.Rmd` file and run the following code in R:

```{r eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::render('L1.1-course-introduction.Rmd')
```

# Communication & Help

All course communication will be managed through [Slack](https://6574-s11-f19.slack.com/).

**Please don't email the instructors** - just use Slack.

> [Watch this 2-minute video for a quick summary of Slack](https://youtu.be/9RJZMSsH7-g)

**You can use Slack to**:

- Ask questions.
- Ask for help with an assignment.
- Send direct, private messages to each other or the instructors (just like email...but better!)

**Asking for help on Slack**:

Slack can be used to ask quick questions and receive quick responses without attending office hours in person. This also enables other students to see answers to common questions. Questions should be specific and include all needed information. For example, if your code has an error you don't understand, **include the code and the error message** in your question.

**Other Help Resources**:

- **Office Hours**: Office hours let you ask questions to TAs and professors directly, and can help you understand concepts and debug programs that you're struggling with alone.
- **Library Services**: While the University Library is not a stand in for TAs, you can schedule a consultation for general help with Coding, Programming, Data, Statistical, and GIS. See more at https://academiccommons.gwu.edu/writing-research-help

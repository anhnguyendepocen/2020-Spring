# R and RStudio

## What's the difference?

R is a programming language that runs computations while RStudio is an *integrated development environment (IDE)* - an interface for working in R with many convenient features and tools.

You can think of the two like this:

* R is like a car's _engine_.
* RStudio is like a car's _dashboard_.

R: Engine            |  RStudio: Dashboard
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](images/engine.jpg){ width=200 }  |  ![](images/dashboard.jpg){ width=250 }

Your car needs an engine (R) to run, but having a speedometer and rear view mirrors (RStudio) makes driving a lot easier.

## Installing R and RStudio

You will first need to download and install both R and RStudio (Desktop version) on your computer.

1. [Download and install R](https://cloud.r-project.org).
2. [Download and install RStudio (Desktop version)](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/).

## Using R via RStudio

After you install R and RStudio on your computer, you'll have two new applications you can open. **We will always work in RStudio**. In other words:

<div class="tableMedium">
R: Do not open this          |  RStudio: Open this
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](images/Rlogo.png){ width=50 }  |  ![](images/RStudio-Ball.png){ width=50 }
</div>

After you open RStudio, you should see the following:

Notice the default panes:

  * Console (entire left)
  * Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)
  * Files/Plots/Packages/Help (tabbed in lower right)

FYI: you can change the default location of the panes, among many other things: [Customizing RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200549016-Customizing-RStudio).

Go into the Console on the left with the `>` (that's the *command prompt*), and let's get started!

# Healy: "Getting Started"

Now that you've got R and RStudio installed, read the ["Getting Started"](http://socviz.co/gettingstarted.html) lesson in [Healy](http://socviz.co/). We will follow the conventions laid out in this chapter throughout the class, such as working in plain text and using RMarkdown to conduct and report on our analyses.

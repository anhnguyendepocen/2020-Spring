This course provides undergraduate students with a foundation in exploring data in the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). Students will learn how to work with a wide variety of data types and structures as well as fundamental concepts in information visualization. All analyses will be conducted to support reproducibility from raw data to results using RMarkdown. Students will be assessed through quizzes, exams, and a final project. Teaching will involve interactive lectures and recitations with a lot time spent live coding. At the end of the semester, students will demonstrate mastery of the course's topics by working on a 3-week project. This course assumes students have taken EMSE 6574: Programming for Analytics as a prerequisite.

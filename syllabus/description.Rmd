This course provides students with a foundation in exploring data using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). Students will learn how to manage, transform, and explore a wide variety of data types and structures. Students will also master the fundamental concepts for visualizing and communicating information contained in raw data, including the human psychology of visual information processing. All analyses will be conducted to support reproducibility from raw data to results using [RMarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/). Teaching will involve interactive lectures and recitations with plenty of class time spent live coding. Students will be assessed through quizzes and exams, and at the end of the semester students will demonstrate mastery of the course's topics by working on a 3-week final project involving a dataset of their choosing.

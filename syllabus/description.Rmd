This course provides undergraduate students with a foundation in exploring data in the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). Students will learn how to work with a wide variety of data types and structures as well as fundamental concepts in visualizing and communicating information contained in data. All analyses will be conducted to support reproducibility from raw data to results using RMarkdown. Teaching will involve interactive lectures and recitations with a lot time spent live coding. Students will be assessed through quizzes and exams, and at the end of the semester students will demonstrate mastery of the course's topics by working on a 3-week project.

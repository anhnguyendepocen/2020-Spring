### Description

This course provides students with a foundation in exploring data using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). Students will learn how to source, manage, transform, and explore a wide variety of data types. Students will also master the fundamental concepts for visualizing and communicating information contained in raw data, including the human psychology of visual information processing. All analyses will be conducted to support reproducibility from raw data to results using [RMarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/). Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of class time spent working on examples and coding. Students will be assessed through quizzes and exams. Throughout the semester, students will work on a research project of their own design to demonstrate mastery of the course's topics. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project and will give a 5-minute presentation of their findings.

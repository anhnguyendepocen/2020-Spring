# General proposal feedback

--
- Your research question should be a question (e.g. "what...?", "why...?", "how...?").

--
- Your projects are _exploratory_: your goal isn't to "prove" something true or false, but rather to identify evidence that _generates_ hypotheses.
--

- Testing hypotheses is "confirmatory" analysis, which we won't cover in this class.

# Writing a research question

Following [these guidelines](https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides/how-to-write-a-research-question), your question should be:

- **Clear**: your audience can easily understand its purpose without additional explanation.
- **Focused**: it is narrow enough that it can be addressed thoroughly with the data available and within the limits of the final project report.
- **Concise**: it is expressed in the fewest possible words.
- **Complex**: it is not answerable with a simple "yes" or "no," but rather requires synthesis and analysis of data.
- **Arguable**: its potential answers are open to debate rather than accepted facts (do others care about it?)

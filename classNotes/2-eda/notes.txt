EDA:
Although there are no formalized set of steps for conducting an EDA, the typical process involves 1) generating questions about the data, 2) searching for answers to those questions through data visualizations and summaries, and 3) using the results to refine the original questions and/or generate new questions (Wickham & Grolemund, 2016).

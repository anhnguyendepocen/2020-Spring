Use example of change in top 10 milk producers between 1970 and 2017

“At the heart of quantitative reasoning is a single question: Compared to what?”
- Edward Tufte

1. Intro

2. Ranking things (bars, dots, lollipops)

- One of the most fundamental ways to compare things is to rank them
- We've been doing this
- Here are a couple other ways.
- Dots are good when ________
- lollipops are good when ________

3. Comparing two things (dodged bars, slope chart, dumbbell chart)

- dodged comparisons are fine, but really no more than 2 things.
- Using facets to break up 3-4 groups of 2 is okay.
- A better approach for multiple categories is slope charts or dumbbell charts

4. Comparing things to a benchmark (benchmark line, diverging bars / lollipops, overlapping bars)

- In any of these plots, adding a benchmark can be really useful
- examples: dumbbell with benchmark, bullet with benchmark
- Another way is to compare things to a **computed** benchmark, like the mean - diverging bars / lollipops
- Finally, overlapping bars are great when you want to show when something exceeds a threshold. E.g. going over your budget.

5. Comparing distributions

- Box plots
- Transparent histograms & densities (good for maybe 2 categories)
- Ridgeline plots (good for lots of categories)

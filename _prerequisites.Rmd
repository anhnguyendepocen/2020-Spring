Students should have taken [Programming for Analytics](https://emse-p4a-gwu.github.io/) or have experience with at least one programming language. Experience with R is preferred, but not essential. If you're not sure whether you have the prerequisite skills required for this class, consider completing the optional [Assignment 0](assignment0.html) prior to the start of classes.

# For new students

Students taking this course should have already taken [Programming for Analytics](https://emse-p4a-gwu.github.io/). If you haven't, you can try and get up to speed by completing [Assignment 0](assignment0.html) **before classes start**. Once classes start, it may be difficult to keep up without this background, and it may be more beneficial to wait and take this course next year after taking Programming for Analytics in the Fall of 2020.

# What's new?

Students taking this course should have already taken [Programming for Analytics](https://emse-p4a-gwu.github.io/). If you haven't, I **strongly** recommend you review the lessons and assignments on the [previous semester website](https://emse6574-gwu.github.io/2019-Fall/). You can also get up to speed by completing [Assignment 0](assignment0.html).

While this course follows a similar structure as P4A, there will be several key distinctions:

1. Whereas in P4A we worked with nice, tidy data sets, in this course we will be working more with messier, "raw" data that often needs to be significantly processed before being able to explore it.
2. Rather than solve puzzles (e.g. write the function `isPrime()`), assignments will involve more real-world data problems that often have multiple, subjective solutions.
3. Style and aesthetics will matter - consider your assignments and your final project to be professional data products that you would want to show off to future employers.

# Course mantras

Here are some philosophies that will get you far in data analytic work. We will be revisiting these over and over again.

**1) Embrace plain text**

You will write code to produce rich outputs that include text and graphics. While your output may have lots of different formatting, your code will be written in [**plain text**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text).

**2) Embrace reproducibility**

Everything you produce in this course will be a [reproducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility) output. That is, you should be able to reproduce your output from the raw data and code. For example, This webpage was generated from [this markdown source file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emse-eda-gwu/2020-Spring/master/L1.1-course-introduction.Rmd) on GitHub.

If you want to generate this very HTML page, download the `.Rmd` file, then open it in RStudio and run the following code:

```{r eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::render('L1.1-course-introduction.Rmd')
```

# The syllabus

The [syllabus](syllabus.html) is lengthy, but I do expect you to look through each section. If any changes need to be made, you'll be notified through Slack.

# The schedule

The course [schedule](schedule.html) is your roadmap for the semester. Visit it often to make sure you are well-prepared for class and aware of upcoming assignment / quiz dates.

# Setup

To prepare for class, you'll need to do a few things. First, use your **@gwu.edu** email address to register for the following:

- [Slack](https://emse-eda-s20.slack.com) - a link to sign up for the course slack page can be found on the one (and only) announcement on Blackboard.
- Install the Slack app on your phone and **Turn notifications on!**
- DataCamp.com - you must use your @gwu.edu email for this to work (not the @email.gwu.edu). **An invite link can be found in in the announcement on Blackboard or in Slack**
- [RStudio Cloud](https://login.rstudio.cloud/register) - we'll use this for some in-class activities and quizzes.

Next, install R and RStudio:

- [Download and install R](https://cloud.r-project.org).
- [Download and install RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (Desktop version).

After you install R and RStudio on your computer, you'll have two new applications you can open. **We will always work in RStudio**. In other words:

<div style="width:150px">
Open this   | Not this
:----------:|:----------:

</div>

# Communication & Help

This can be a challenging class - don't suffer in silence! Look at the ["Getting Help"](getting-help.html) page, come to office hours, send me a message on Slack.

# Readings!

Now that you've got R and RStudio installed, read the ["Getting Started"](http://socviz.co/gettingstarted.html) lesson in [Healy](http://socviz.co/). We will follow the conventions laid out in this chapter throughout the class, including:

- Using [RStudio Projects](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html) to stay organized.
- Working in plain text.
- Using RMarkdown to conduct and report on our analyses.

Also, check out the [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/articles/readr.html) and [**readxl**](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/) packages - we'll be using these throughout the semester to import data into R.

Finally, read through [this guide](https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides/how-to-write-a-research-question), from GMU on how to write a research question. We'll come back to these ideas again later when you start working on your final projects, but it's a good idea to start thinking about your research question early.
